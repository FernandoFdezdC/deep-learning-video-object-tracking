# deep-learning-video-object-tracking

Training of a Video Tracking deep learning model using different distance between objects in network space calculations: Intersection over Union. Then, association follows using Hungarian algorithm. Also includes managing of false detections. The object detection algorithm used has a Fast-RCNN architecture. The video dataset used is MOT16.
